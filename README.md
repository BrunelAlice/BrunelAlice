I am currently working with **TypeScript and MobX** for **Dotter.Science**. [Go say "Hi"!](https://www.dotter.science/)

I have a background in **UX design**, **graphic design** and I have done several trainings in **Agile Project Management**. My current stack is composed of **React/TypeScript, Mongo DB, NodeJS**, with **MobX** and **Redux** as states manager. I work with **CSS preprocessor (Sass)**.

## ðŸ”­ Projects I am working on
I am working on a big project that I cannot share here, so I thought I would showcase my **Hangman game**. I decided to go with a specific vintage inspired design, which I would like to improve and animate. The game logic is done, you are welcome to have a look over here: https://github.com/BrunelAlice/hangman

I lost access to my previous portfolio that you can access here : https://github.com/AliceBrunel

Currently, I am working on a client project with **TypeScript** on React with **MongoDB**, from which I learn a lot. As a bootcamp graduate and mostly self-taught, I like to keep learning on my favourite platforms. I am also enrolled in the **CS50 course**, which I will talk about in my soon to come tech blog.
