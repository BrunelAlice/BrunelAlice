### Hi there 👋 I'm Alice
- 😄 Pronouns: she / her
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicebrunel/

I am a freelance creative web developer. 🙏🏽 I love beautiful things and I hate bad UX. I am currently working with **JavaScript (React/Redux)**. I have a background in **UX design** and **graphic design**, I have done several trainings in Agile Project Management and regarding code languages, I learned **Ruby (RoR)** and **SQL** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQlite). Thank you for passing by!

## 🔭 Projects I am working on
At present, I had the chance to participate in a bootcamp with HyperionDev and I want to showcase a **Hangman game**. I decided to go with a specific vintage inspired design, which I would like to improve and animate. The game logic is done, you are welcome to have a look over here: https://github.com/BrunelAlice/hangman

Otherwise, I am working on building a portfolio of **animated elements and animated websites**. I don't have much time to work on it though, as I am <ins>currently booked</ins> as a freelance developer.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
Currently, I am working on a client project with **TypeScript** on React with **MongoDB**. I am also diving into **GSAP** but my ultimate goal is to master **WebGL**, to provide immersive experiences - this will take some times, I know... I also want to learn **Three.js** to explore coding in 3D, and **Animate.js** for intermediary animations.

## ⚡ About me
I am a mum, a gamer and a entrepreneure. I believe that coding can be turned into art and that the creativity it offers should be used for a good purpose.
