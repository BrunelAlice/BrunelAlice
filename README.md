### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alice, freelance creative developer
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she / her
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicebrunel/

I am currently working with **TypeScript and MobX** for **Dotter.Science**. [Go say "Hi"!](https://www.dotter.science/)

I have a background in **UX design** and **graphic design** and I have done several trainings in Agile Project Management. My current stack is composed of **TypeScript, React, Vanilla JavaScript**, with **MobX** and **Redux** as state manager. 

## ðŸ”­ Projects I am working on
Obviously, I am working on my clients projects, but I also would like to showcase my **Hangman game**. I decided to go with a specific vintage inspired design, which I would like to improve and animate. The game logic is done, you are welcome to have a look over here: https://github.com/BrunelAlice/hangman

Otherwise, I am working on building a portfolio of **animated elements and animated websites**. I don't have much time to work on it though, as I am <ins>currently booked</ins> as a freelance developer.

I lost access to my previous portfolio that you can access here : https://github.com/AliceBrunel

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
Currently, I am working on a client project with **TypeScript** on React with **MongoDB**, from which I learn a lot. I am also diving into **GSAP** but my ultimate goal is to master **WebGL**, to provide immersive experiences - this will take some times, I know... I also want to learn **Three.js** to explore coding in 3D, and **Animate.js** for intermediary animations.

## âš¡ About me
I live in UK but originally from France, a mum and gamer, a passionate about good design and creative coding. Making websites that are pretty AND usable is a difficult goal to attain, but it is the one I am working for.
