### Hi there 👋 I'm Alice
- 😄 Pronouns: she / her
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicebrunel/

I am a freelance creative web developer. 🙏🏽 My goal is to learn as much as I can and challenge myself to create beautiful and eye-pleasing websites and components. I am currently working with JavaScript (React/Redux). I have a background in UX design and graphic design, and regarding code languages, I also learned Ruby (RoR) and SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQlite). Thank you for passing by!

## 🔭 Projects I am working on
At present, I had the chance to participate in a bootcamp with HyperionDev and to work on a **Hangman game**. I decided to go with a specific vintage inspired design, which I would like to improve and animate. The game logic is done though, you are welcome to have a look over here: https://github.com/BrunelAlice/hangman

Otherwise, I am working on building a portfolio of **animated elements and animated websites**. 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
Currently, I am diving into **GSAP** but my ultimate goal is to master **WebGL**, to provide immersive experiences. I also want to learn **Three.js** to explore coding in 3D, and **Animate.js** for intermediary animations.

## ⚡ About me
I am a mum, a gamer and a slowpreneur. I believe that coding can be turned into art and that the creativity it offers should be used for a good purpose. I want to work on project that have a positive impact on the world and society.
