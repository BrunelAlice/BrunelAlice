### Hi there 👋 I'm Alice, freelance creative developer
- 😄 Pronouns: she / her
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicebrunel/
- Currently fully booked! 🎉

I am currently working with **TypeScript and MobX** for **Dotter.Science**. [Go say "Hi"!](https://www.dotter.science/)

I have a background in **UX design** and **graphic design** and I have done several trainings in Agile Project Management. My current stack is composed of **React/TypeScript, Mongo DB, NodeJS**, with **MobX** and **Redux** as states manager. I work with **CSS preprocessor (Sass)**.

## 🔭 Projects I am working on
I am working on a big project that I cannot share here, so I thought I would showcase my **Hangman game**. I decided to go with a specific vintage inspired design, which I would like to improve and animate. The game logic is done, you are welcome to have a look over here: https://github.com/BrunelAlice/hangman

I lost access to my previous portfolio that you can access here : https://github.com/AliceBrunel

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
Currently, I am working on a client project with **TypeScript** on React with **MongoDB**, from which I learn a lot. I am following the CS50 course, which I will talk about in my soon to come tech blog.

## ⚡ About me
I live in London in the UK but I'm originally from Paris, France, and I am a mum 👶🏽 and a gamer 🎮.
